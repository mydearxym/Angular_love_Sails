/**

 *
 * By default, new Sails projects are configured to compile this file
 * from LESS to CSS.  Unlike CSS files, LESS files are not compiled and
 * included automatically unless they are imported below.
 *
 * The LESS files imported below are compiled and included in the order
 * they are listed.  Mixins, variables, etc. should be imported first
 * so that they can be accessed by subsequent LESS stylesheets.
 *
 * (Just like the rest of the asset pipeline bundled in Sails, you can
 * always omit, customize, or replace this behavior with SASS, SCSS,
 * or any other Grunt tasks you like.)

// For example:

// @import 'variables/colors.less';
// @import 'mixins/foo.less';
// @import 'mixins/bar.less';
// @import 'mixins/baz.less';

// @import 'styleguide.less';
// @import 'pages/login.less';
// @import 'pages/signup.less';

/**
 * This is the main application stylesheet. It should include or import all

/**
 * First, we include the Twitter Bootstrap LESS files. Only the ones used in the
 * project should be imported as the rest are just wasting space.
